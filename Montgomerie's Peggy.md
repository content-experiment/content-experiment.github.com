---  
Tune--"Galla Water."  
  
  
Altho' my bed were in yon muir,  
Amang the heather, in my plaidie;  
Yet happy, happy would I be,  
Had I my dear Montgomerie's Peggy.  
  
When o'er the hill beat surly storms,  
And winter nights were dark and rainy;  
I'd seek some dell, and in my arms  
I'd shelter dear Montgomerie's Peggy.  
  
Were I a baron proud and high,  
And horse and servants waiting ready;  
Then a' 'twad gie o' joy to me,--  
The sharin't with Montgomerie's Peggy.
