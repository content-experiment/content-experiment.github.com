title: Ah, Woe Is Me, My Mother Dear
---  
  
Paraphrase of Jeremiah, 15th Chap., 10th verse.  
  
Ah, woe is me, my mother dear!  
A man of strife ye've born me:  
For sair contention I maun bear;  
They hate, revile, and scorn me.  
  
I ne'er could lend on bill or band,  
That five per cent. might blest me;  
And borrowing, on the tither hand,  
The deil a ane wad trust me.  
  
Yet I, a coin-denied wight,  
By Fortune quite discarded;  
Ye see how I am, day and night,  
By lad and lass blackguarded!
