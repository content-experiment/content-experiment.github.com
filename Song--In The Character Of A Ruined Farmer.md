title: In The Character Of A Ruined Farmer (song)  
---  
  
Tune--"Go from my window, Love, do."  
  
  
The sun he is sunk in the west,  
All creatures retired to rest,  
While here I sit, all sore beset,  
With sorrow, grief, and woe:  
And it's O, fickle Fortune, O!  
  
The prosperous man is asleep,  
Nor hears how the whirlwinds sweep;  
But Misery and I must watch  
The surly tempest blow:  
And it's O, fickle Fortune, O!  
  
There lies the dear partner of my breast;  
Her cares for a moment at rest:  
Must I see thee, my youthful pride,  
Thus brought so very low!  
And it's O, fickle Fortune, O!  
  
There lie my sweet babies in her arms;  
No anxious fear their little hearts alarms;  
But for their sake my heart does ache,  
With many a bitter throe:  
And it's O, fickle Fortune, O!  
  
I once was by Fortune carest:  
I once could relieve the distrest:  
Now life's poor support, hardly earn'd  
My fate will scarce bestow:  
And it's O, fickle Fortune, O!  
  
No comfort, no comfort I have!  
How welcome to me were the grave!  
But then my wife and children dear--  
O, wither would they go!  
And it's O, fickle Fortune, O!  
  
O whither, O whither shall I turn!  
All friendless, forsaken, forlorn!  
For, in this world, Rest or Peace  
I never more shall know!  
And it's O, fickle Fortune, O!
