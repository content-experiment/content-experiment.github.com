title: Handsome Nell (Song)  
---  
  
Tune--"I am a man unmarried."  
  
  
(Footnote 1: The first of my performances.--R. B.)  
  
Once I lov'd a bonie lass,  
Ay, and I love her still;  
And whilst that virtue warms my breast,  
I'll love my handsome Nell.  
  
As bonie lasses I hae seen,  
And mony full as braw;  
But, for a modest gracefu' mein,  
The like I never saw.  
  
A bonie lass, I will confess,  
Is pleasant to the e'e;  
But, without some better qualities,  
She's no a lass for me.  
  
But Nelly's looks are blythe and sweet,  
And what is best of a',  
Her reputation is complete,  
And fair without a flaw.  
  
She dresses aye sae clean and neat,  
Both decent and genteel;  
And then there's something in her gait  
Gars ony dress look weel.  
  
A gaudy dress and gentle air  
May slightly touch the heart;  
But it's innocence and modesty  
That polishes the dart.  
  
'Tis this in Nelly pleases me,  
'Tis this enchants my soul;  
For absolutely in my breast  
She reigns without control..
